# Life Expectancy and Local School Spending in England, UK
## Problem Statement
In this project, we look to at **average life expectancy** at birth across regions in England between 2016 and 2018 and compare this to **local authority spending on schools** in England by region between 2017 and 2018. From these datasets we want to see if there is a positive correlation between average life expectancy and public spending in England.

The data for average life expectancy was found from the dataset [Health state life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years by local areas](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/datasets/healthstatelifeexpectancyatbirthandatage65bylocalareasuk), UK Office for National Statistics (ONS), released on the 11th December 2019

The data for local authority spending was found from the dataset [LA and school expenditure: 2017 to 2018 financial year](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/la-and-school-expenditure-2017-to-2018-financial-year) which looks at how schools and local authorities spent their funding on education, children's services and social care in the financial year 2017 to 2018.
